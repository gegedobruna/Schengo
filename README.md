## About the 90/180 Rule

The Schengen 90/180 rule means that you can stay in the Schengen area for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period. This rule applies to non-EU citizens who don't need a visa to enter the Schengen area.

### Key Points:
- 90 days maximum in any 180-day rolling period
- The 180-day window is calculated backwards from any given date
- Days are counted from your entry date
- Includes all Schengen countries
- Overlapping stays are automatically merged to prevent double-counting

### Schengen Countries:
Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
